# PartsManager-ASP.NET-MVC
This project is a simple CRUD application using fictional space craft, and parts from the game Elite Dangerous.  
The purpose of this project is to practice what I have learned through my studies.  When I learn something new I come to this application
to add functionality. This application is a technical manual for the fictional space craft mechanic.  This application provides the 
fictional space craft mechanic a detailed catalog of the parts(modules) found in various space craft.  Future expansion of this application 
will include removal and installation procedures for the individual parts(modules), manufacturer list, warnings, tool list, and perhaps 
instructional video.  Contact swmooneyham@gmail.com for any questions you may have.
